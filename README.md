# M.SC._Regression_Analysis_Project
Assignment on Regression Analysis Paper during M.Sc. in UOH (2018-2020)

**Start Date:** 10-1-2019

**End Date:** 18-11-2019

During the Masters Programme (2018-2020) at University of Hyderabad, I did a Case Study project for the paper of Regression Analysis in Semester - III.

While carrying out this project, the primary steps were:

1. Selection of a real life dataset - "Life Expectancy (WHO)".
2. After choosing the data, examining and understanding the data characteristics.
3. Finding out the purpose of the analysis from the chosen dataset.
4. Explanatory Data Analysis.
5. Model Building and Development of the best selected model.
6. Estimation of model parameter and prediction error.
7. Residual Analysis.

After the completion of the project, the project work and conclusions were presented through a class **Presentation**, followed by submitting a Report to the Project Guide, stating few of future studies and the overview of future scopes that can be performed on the dataset.

##**Brief Summary of Project work**##

*Dataset:* Life Expectancy (WHO) from Kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who/data

*Objective:* Case Study using Regression Analysis Techniques

*Steps:*
1. Explanatory Data Analysis using Numerical and Graphical methods.
2. Fitting Linear Model on training set, with Life Expectancy as the Dependent Variable.
3. To resolve the issue of Multicollinearity, selected the best model from three fitted models created by applying viz.,
    1. Removal of variables with high Variance Inflation Factor (VIF).
    2. Principal Component Regression.
    3. Ridge Regression.
4. Generation of model using Variable Selection and Step Regression Method.
5. Found out the best predictor variables that affect Life Expectancy and developed the final selected model with least prediction error.
6. Checked validity of assumptions and carried out residual analysis.

*Technology used:* **R**
